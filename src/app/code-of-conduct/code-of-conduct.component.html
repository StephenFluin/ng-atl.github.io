      <h2>ngAtl Code of Conduct</h2>

      All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at ngAtl are required to agree with the following code
      of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to
      help ensure a safe, welcoming and inclusive environment for everybody.

      <h2>The Quick Version</h2>

      ngAtl is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of
      gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
      ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), financial status, political views, or technology choices. We do not
      tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any
      conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. ngAtl participants
      violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the
      conference organisers.

      <h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>

      Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual
      orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, financial status, political
      views, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing
      photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and
      unwelcome sexual attention.

      Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

      Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images,
      activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised
      clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

      If a participant engages in harassing behavior, ngAtl organisers may take any action they deem
      appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from ngAtl with no refund.

      If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact
      a member of ngAtl conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded
      clothing and/or badges.

      ngAtl staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide
      escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We
      value your attendance.

      We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social
      events.
